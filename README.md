# Clarity Instruction Manual
Step 1: Open the sign in page first! All of our code hinges upon a user session id that comes from logging in.
Step 2: We have made several test accounts already, so try using id:user and pass:user for a user account, and id:admin and pass:admin for an admin account.
Step 3: Have fun! Clarity is a fully-functioning web app, so feel free to test it out and submit cards to your heart's content!
